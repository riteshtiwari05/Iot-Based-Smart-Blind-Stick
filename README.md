# IoT-Based Smart Blind Stick

## Introduction

The **IoT-Based Smart Blind Stick** is an assistive device designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate their environment safely. It leverages sensors and IoT technology to detect obstacles, track location, and provide real-time feedback to the user via a speaker or vibration motor. This project offers an affordable and practical solution for enhancing mobility and independence for visually impaired people.

## Features

- **Obstacle Detection**: Uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles in the user's path and alerts them using sound or vibration feedback.
- **GPS Tracking**: Allows real-time tracking of the user’s location via GPS and sends data to a mobile application or cloud platform for remote monitoring.
- **IoT Integration**: Data can be sent to a cloud server for analysis or alerting caregivers in case of emergency (optional).
- **Voice Assistance**: Audio alerts for obstacle detection, GPS tracking status, and other functionalities.
- **Rechargeable**: Powered by a rechargeable battery.
  
## Components Used

1. **Microcontroller**: Arduino Uno/ESP32 (for Wi-Fi and IoT functionality)
2. **Ultrasonic Sensors**: To detect nearby obstacles
3. **GPS Module**: For location tracking
4. **Vibration Motor/Buzzer**: Provides feedback to the user (vibration/sound)
5. **Rechargeable Battery**: For powering the stick
6. **IoT Platform**: Optional (e.g., Blynk, MQTT, etc.)
7. **Mobile App (Optional)**: For remote tracking and notifications

## Project Architecture

- **Hardware Layer**: The smart stick is embedded with sensors (ultrasonic for obstacle detection, GPS for location), which are interfaced with the microcontroller (ESP8266/ESP32). A power supply unit, typically a rechargeable battery, is included to provide sufficient energy to power all components.
  
- **Software Layer**: The microcontroller runs the firmware that processes the sensor data, controls the buzzer/vibration motor for obstacle detection, and communicates with the IoT platform. GPS coordinates are also fetched regularly and sent to the cloud.

- **IoT Layer**: This layer manages data transmission to the cloud, where caregivers can monitor the user’s location and receive alerts if necessary.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Arduino Uno/ESP32
- Arduino IDE
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04 or similar)
- GPS Module (e.g., NEO-6M)
- Vibration motor/Buzzer
- Jumper wires and breadboard
- Rechargeable battery (Li-Ion)
- Wi-Fi access for IoT features

### Steps

1. **Install Arduino IDE**: Download and install the latest version of Arduino IDE.
2. **Install Arduino Uno/ESP32 Libraries**: Add the Arduino Uno/ESP32 board package in the Arduino IDE.
3. **Connect Components**: Wire up the ultrasonic sensor, GPS module, and buzzer/vibration motor to the ESP8266/ESP32 as per the circuit diagram.
4. **Code Upload**: Download the code from this repository and upload it to the ESP8266/ESP32 using Arduino IDE.
5. **IoT Platform Setup (Optional)**: Set up an IoT platform (e.g., Blynk or MQTT) to enable GPS tracking and remote monitoring.
6. **Power the Device**: Connect the rechargeable battery and test the device.

### Code Structure

- `main.ino`: Contains the core logic for obstacle detection, GPS tracking, and communication with the IoT platform.
- `wifi_config.h`: Configuration file for setting up Wi-Fi credentials.
- `gps_module.ino`: Handles the integration and data fetching from the GPS module.
- `iot_communication.ino`: Manages data transmission to the IoT platform.

## How It Works

1. **Obstacle Detection**: The ultrasonic sensor continuously scans the area in front of the user. If an obstacle is detected within a predefined range (e.g., 1 meter), the buzzer/vibration motor alerts the user.
   
2. **GPS Tracking**: The GPS module sends location data to the microcontroller, which uploads it to the cloud at regular intervals, allowing caregivers to track the user’s location in real-time.
   
3. **IoT Alerts**: If the device detects an obstacle or any potential danger (e.g., the user remains in one location for too long), an alert is sent to the caregiver via the IoT platform.

## Mobile Application (Optional)

If using a mobile app for remote monitoring:
- Download the Blynk app or any other IoT platform-supported app.
- Set up a dashboard to visualize GPS data and receive alerts.
- Add widgets such as maps, buttons, or notifications as needed.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate voice commands for more user-friendly navigation.
- Add fall detection using an accelerometer.
- Increase battery life by optimizing power consumption.
- Implement Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for local device pairing.

## Troubleshooting

1. **No Obstacle Detection**: Ensure that the ultrasonic sensor is properly wired, and the connections are secure.
2. **No GPS Signal**: The GPS module may take a few minutes to lock onto satellites. Make sure it is in an open area with a clear view of the sky.
3. **IoT Not Working**: Check the Wi-Fi connection and ensure that the IoT platform credentials are correctly configured.
